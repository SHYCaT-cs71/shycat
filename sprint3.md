## Sprint Planning 2024-12-02

#### Present
* Shelby Grasso (Product Owner and Developer)
* Hamza Hashmi
* Yu Lai
* Christina Molodowitch
* Tyler Malka (Scrum Master and Developer)

Only Developers participated in this activity.

**_Goal:_** Display pulled in events.  
**_Forecast_**: 12 story points  
**_Rationale_**: We didn't finish all the issues in the previous sprint, but that was largely due to the loss of time from the holidays, and we hadn't expected to finish based on our forecast (9) vs the story points in the sprint (11).  For this sprint, per the retrospective and associated backlog item, we're going to focus on pair programming so we can take advantage of our different skill sets and work in parallel.  This means we hope to get more accomplished even compared to our first sprint, which was 11 story points.
