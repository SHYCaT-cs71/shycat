**_Goal:_** Set up a minimal back end to communicate with front end and display the info.  
**_Forecast_**: 9 story points  
**_Rationale_**: We're forecasting fewer story points than the last sprint in part because of the upcoming holiday, which means our sprint has fewer effective work days.  Also, we barely finished the items in the previous sprint (we didn't allocate enough time for debugging).  We're pulling in 10 points worth of items, but are anticipating that we may not finish the last item due to the holidays.

Pulled in backlog items:
1. [SHY-29 (Clarification on mob programming/priorities)](https://evilore.atlassian.net/browse/SHY-29)
2. [SHY-2 (User-created events - back end)](https://evilore.atlassian.net/browse/SHY-2)
3. [SHY-44 (User-created events - front end)](https://evilore.atlassian.net/browse/SHY-44)
4. [SHY-13 (Detailed event view)](https://evilore.atlassian.net/browse/SHY-13)

Note that we forgot to update the Sprint name before starting the sprint!  This is fixed later - see Kanban Board screenshots below.

## Group Programming Sessions

### Mob Programming 2024-11-20
Following the feedback from the instructor, we realized that we needed to pivot our sprint to focus more on "algorithms and data-structures that you can build test-first", instead of the additional front end components that made up the bulk of our planned tasks.  For this reason, we decided to switch to back end development with a focus on web scraping as that offers more scope for this type of coding.

The mob programming session was therefore spent in developing an initial back end with persistence for the "Event" data that will be filled in from the scraped webpages and provided to the front end list display.
