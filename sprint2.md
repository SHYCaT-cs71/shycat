# Sprint: 2024-12-02 Sprint 2

Product website:

Back end:
* [Event List Endpoint](https://api.shycat.fyi/events)
* [Health Endpoint](https://api.shycat.fyi/health)

For this project, we used Spring Initializr to generate the structure for the Java Spring-based back end.  We used ChatGPT to generate the sample SQL script used for repository testing and integration REST controller testing.

**_Goal:_** Set up a minimal back end to communicate with front end and display the info.  
**_Forecast_**: 9 story points  
**_Rationale_**: We're forecasting fewer story points than the last sprint in part because of the upcoming holiday, which means our sprint has fewer effective work days.  Also, we barely finished the items in the previous sprint (we didn't allocate enough time for debugging).  We're pulling in 10 points worth of items, but are anticipating that we may not finish the last item due to the holidays.

Pulled in backlog items:
1. [SHY-29 (Clarification on mob programming/priorities)](https://evilore.atlassian.net/browse/SHY-29)
2. [SHY-2 (User-created events - back end)](https://evilore.atlassian.net/browse/SHY-2)
3. [SHY-44 (User-created events - front end)](https://evilore.atlassian.net/browse/SHY-44)
4. [SHY-13 (Detailed event view)](https://evilore.atlassian.net/browse/SHY-13)

Only Developers participated in this activity.

Following feedback from instructor to "recast your project to be more in line with a computer science course" and "to see algorithms and data structures that you can build test-first", we met again to refocus/update our PBIs and plan for the sprint.  We wanted to prioritize algorithms and more readily testable code instead of our previous plan, which focused on building additional front end components (event submission form and detailed event view).

We removed SHY-2, SHY-13, and SHY-44, and replaced them with:
* [SHY-4 (Automatically find new events from Harvard events calendar)](https://evilore.atlassian.net/browse/SHY-4)
* [SHY-62 (Consistent information for each event)](https://evilore.atlassian.net/browse/SHY-62)

Note that SHY-4 was originally several items down in the Product Backlog, so wasn't initially ready to be pulled into a sprint - in part because it was too large and non-specific.  We decomposed it into SHY-4 and SHY-62, and added acceptance criteria and programmer tasks.

However, as noted in the discussion on Slack, the Kanban Board we're using disappears when the Sprint is closed.  Below are screenshots of the board at different points in the Sprint.

* [Framework](images/screenshots/Sprint_2024-12-02/Screenshot%202024-11-24%20113610.png)
* [Answering questions](images/screenshots/Sprint_2024-12-02/Screenshot%202024-11-24%20114738.png)

#### What did you do in the last 24 hours that helped you meet the Sprint Goal?
* **Shelby:** Looked into web scraping to become more familiar with it, especially in Java.  Also worked with practice React app.  Confirmed with Alexa (stakeholder) that she's available to meet for Sprint Review on Monday morning 12/2/2024.
* **Hamza:** Investigated Java and Spring in particular.  Also went over how to set up an AWS EC2 instance for use with the back end.
* **Yu:** Worked on refining user stories in Product Backlog Items, based on feedback from professor.
* **Christina:** Prepped for next mob programming session.  Reviewed Spring Boot testing/annotations and investigated Harvard events calendar website data structure.  Downloaded sample web pages and created some test data that could be used in unit tests.
* **Tyler:** Focused on realigning team to meet the new requirement from professor, brainstormed options on how best to incorporate going forward.

#### What will you do in the next 24 hours to meet the Sprint Goal?
* **Shelby:** Participate in mob programming when available, continue to investigate Java/React libraries.
* **Hamza:** Help write back end, prepare for AWS EC2 instance creation to run the back end.
* **Yu:** Participate in mob programming, continue refining user stories based on team discussion/new requirements.
* **Christina:** Participate in mob programming, break down sample data further to make it usable in narrowly-focused unit tests.
* **Tyler:** Participate in mob programming, help to update current and future sprint goals and issues.

#### Do you see any impediment that prevents the Developers from meeting the Sprint Goal? What are the impediments?
* **Shelby:** None, other than availability (travel)
* **Hamza:** Availability, on call this week so may have to suddenly drop out of sessions.
* **Yu:** Had trouble in refining user stories, particularly the pair around creating new events that were separate into front end vs back end - 
* **Christina:** Scheduling/availability (holidays and other responsibilities)
* **Tyler:** Scheduling, other responsibilities

#### What is your impediment removal plan?
To cope with the scheduling/availability problems, we plan to adopt agile flexibility in scheduling meetings and setting up programming sessions, switching to pair programming at times to reduce the number of people whose schedules need to align.  
To address the issue with the current backlog items and sprint plan not meeting the instructor requirements based on feedback, today we will refocus the sprint and update backlog items.

## Group Programming Sessions

### Mob Programming 2024-11-20
Following the feedback from the instructor, we realized that we needed to pivot our sprint to focus more on "algorithms and data-structures that you can build test-first", instead of the additional front end components that made up the bulk of our planned tasks.  For this reason, we decided to switch to back end development with a focus on web scraping as that offers more scope for this type of coding.

The mob programming session was therefore spent in developing an initial back end with persistence for the "Event" data that will be filled in from the scraped webpages and provided to the front end list display.

### Mob Programming 2024-11-27
We focused on finishing [SHY-62](https://evilore.atlassian.net/browse/SHY-62), specifically updating the front end JSON structure to better match the back end data structure and adding calls to the back end.  We also worked on adding full CI/CD for the front end, and at least CI for the back end.

## Tests Added
* All back end tests are new for this sprint.
    * entities.EventJsonMappingTest (3 tests)
    * repositories.EventRepositoryTest (4 tests)
    * rest.EventControllerIntegrationTest (1 test)
    * rest.EventControllerUnitTest (1 test)
    * rest.HealthControllerUnitTest (1 test)
    * ShycatApplicationTests (1 test)
* Removed (temporarily) 3 front end unit tests from Navbar.test.js, since the elements have also been (temporarily) removed as they're non-functional, per feedback from instructor.
* Added 2 unit tests to EventCard.test.js to check end date rendering and new getSummary() method.
* Added unit test to EventList.test.js to check end date rendering.


## CI/CD Setup
### Front End
We already had CD setup for the front end triggered by a Github push to main, feeding into AWS Amplify.  After some trial and error, we figured out how to modify the configuration file [amplify.yml](amplify.yml) to run an additional `CI=true yarn test` command, so that the build will halt if a test doesn't pass, preventing deployment.

#### Screenshots

* [CI/CD green with all tests passing](images/screenshots/Sprint_2024-12-02/Screenshot%202024-11-30%20111425.png)

### Back End
We first set up CI for the back end using a Github action with a Maven-based workflow [maven.yml](.github/workflows/maven.yml) - note that it's only triggered for updates to the backend folder (or to the `maven.yml` configuration file).  We later figured out how to tie in a deployment to the AWS EC2 instance we're using to run the back end.  The Github action serves to upload the application code, build it (including re-running tests locally), restart it, and do a final health check against the "/health" endpoint to make sure it's running.
