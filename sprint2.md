## Sprint Planning 2024-11-18

Present:
* Shelby Grasso (Product Owner)
* Hamza Hashmi
* Yu Lai
* Christina Molodowitch
* Tyler Malka (Scrum Master)

**Goal:** Set up minimal back end to communicate with front end and display the info
**Forecast**: 9 story points  
**Rationale**: We're forecasting fewer story points than the last sprint in part because of the upcoming holiday, which means our sprint has fewer effective work days.  Also, we barely finished the items in the previous sprint (we didn't allocate enough time for debugging).  We're pulling in 10 points worth of items, but are anticipating that we may not finish the last item due to the holidays.

Pulled in backlog items:
1. [SHY-29 (Clarification on mob programming/priorities)](https://evilore.atlassian.net/browse/SHY-29)
2. [SHY-2 (User-created events - back end)](https://evilore.atlassian.net/browse/SHY-2)
3. [SHY-44 (User-created events - front end)](https://evilore.atlassian.net/browse/SHY-44)
4. [SHY-13 (Detailed event view)](https://evilore.atlassian.net/browse/SHY-13)
